## Baseball Simulator

Inspired by the Strat-O-Matic Baseball board game, Culture Brain's NES cult classic Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Baseball Mogul for the PC, Baseball Simulator is an attempt to create a Ruby on Rails app that drives various baseball simulation functionality:

* Full Season Simulation
* Individual Box Scores
* Scorebook Imaging
* Integration with the Strat-O-Matic board game

This is a long term project (think Perl 6) that aims to implement the aforementioned functionality a little at a time.
